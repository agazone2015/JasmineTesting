//  expect(player.currentlyPlayingSong).toEqual(song);
//
// expect - launching point of any TEST
// eg (player.currentlyPlayingSong) - what we want to test -
// .toEqual(song); or .toBe - COMPARISON METHOD called the
// MATCHER where we passing the expected value eg(song)
//
// or
//
// we can test if something is not by
// expect(what we testing).not.toBe(this result);
//
// SPEC can contain multiple tests, but all tests must return TRUE to PASS
